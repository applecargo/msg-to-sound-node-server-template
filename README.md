# msg-to-sound-node-server-template

this template (or just an example) node server shows:

- socket.io to relay message between clients (all broadcast except the sender)
- clients are smartphones so the sender should fire sound by touch/click, not by network msg. (especially, iOS!)
- here also how to interact with mobmuplat app. using osc.js through OSC protocol

# thanks to...
